# Univ-Jakarta-EE-API

## Introduction

This is a University project created for educational purposes. The goal of this project is to create three different RESTful APIs connected to databases.  
This part of api is responsible for managing orders.  
This api depends on [Dishes and Users API](https://github.com/Edouard-Pon/univ-jakarta-ee-api) and [Menus API](https://github.com/Edouard-Pon/univ-jakarta-ee-api/tree/menus) for dish and menu management.
